|||||||||||||||2 Madlibs activity in console
// Variables
// We need to store a Name and an Adjective. How would we do this?


// prompt()
// Let's prompt the user for a Noun. How would we do this?


// console.log
// Let's put this all together! Print out the following using our stored variables:
// ____ is too _________ for ____. 
// Name        adjective     noun


// alert()
// How could we do this with alert()? 


// Challenge!
// How can we update this console.log() and alert() to use a variable for the entire string?

|||||||||||||3 (functions) Dice in the console
/*
Directions: Make a program that randomly displays a number 1 through 6 to the console 

Instructions:
1. return Math.random() to display a random number between 0 and 1
2. Multiply your Math.random() function by 6
3. Use Math.floor() to only display whole numbers between 0 and 5
4. Add the number one to display a random number between 1 and 6

function dice() {
  //To do: Insert you code below this line
  
} 
    

console.log(dice());

|||||||||||||4 (functions) average of 2 numbers 

/*

Directions: Make a function that computes the average of two numbers

Instructions:
1. Create a function called average with two parameters, x and y
2. Return the sum of x and y divded by 2

Test your function with console.log on 2 sets of inputs (numbers).

/*
So Last Year Function
Directions: Make a program that tells you the grade and age you were last year

Instructions:
1. Declare a function called lastYear.
2. Give the function a parameter named year. 
 2b. Call the function with 2015 as the first parameter
3. In the body of the function, make a return statement that subtracts one from the parameter.
4. Create two console.log statements. 
  4a. one statement should print the grade you were in last year
  4b. one statement should print the age you were in last year

|||||||||||||6 (Functions: hard)
/* 
Directions: Write a function that returns the result of the following equation: 5a^2 + 4b + c. You should use the pow() function. Your function should take in three parameters (a,b,c).

Test your function with console.log() on 3 different sets of inputs.

/*
Feet to Inches Converter
Directions: Make a program that converts an object's size in feet into its size in inches

Instructions:
1. Declare a variable called sizeInFeet and set it equal to 4
2. Declare a variable called sizeInInches and set it equal sizeInFeet times 12 
3. Print the size in inches to the console.

Bonus #1: Print " That object is __ inches tall" to the console
Bonus #2: Use the prompt method to first ask the user "What is the object's size in feet?"

var myCopilot = “Chewbacca”;

console.log(myName + ‘ ‘ + myCopilot + ‘fly the Millenium Falcon;

||||||||||||9 Ten Loops
//0. Using a while loop, print to console starting from 77 up to  88. 
//1. Using a for loop, print to console starting from 77 up to 88. 




//2. Using a while loop, print to console starting from 50 down to 40. 
//3. Using a for loop, print to console starting from 33 down to 22. */




//4. Using a while loop, print to console: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 
//* hint: i=i+1 may need some changing * 
//5. Using a for loop, print to console: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.



//6. Using a for loop, print to console: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.


//7. Using a for loop, print to console 1 to 10 except 7. *hint: use if statements*


//8. Using a for loop, add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 20. Print to console the sum.


//9. Using a for loop, add 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + ... + 2*20. Print to console the sum. 


//10. Using a for loop, print 1 to 10 and whether the number is even an odd. 
//It should print something like: 1 odd, 2 even, 3 odd, ..., 10 even.

||||||||||10 7 Problems with arrays and loops
// Ex 1: Create an array called called 'artistsArray' containing your three favorite artists. 
// Print the whole array using console.log(). 
// The output should look something like: ["Mozart", "Bach", "Beethoven"]
// (Or something a little more modern...)

// Ex 2: For each artist in the array, print "My #1 favorite artist is Mozart"
// (replacing 'Mozart' with the artists in your array).
// Hint: You'll want to use a for loop.

// Ex 3: Add two more artists to your array, and print the updated array.

// Ex 4: Remove the first artist from your array, and print it to the screen.
// Hint: You'll want to use the Javascript shift() function.

// Ex 5: Add "Bieber" to your array. Next, remove him from the array, using the indexOf() and splice() functions.
// Print your array before and after removing Bieber, to make sure it worked.

// Ex 6: Pick a random artist in your array, and print it to the screen.
// Hint: Remember Math.random() ?

// Ex 7 - CHALLENGE:
// Create another array called 'songsArray.' For each artist in your 'artistsArray' array, add your favorite
// song by that artist in 'songsArray.' Make sure the artists & the songs are in the same order.
// Next, use a loop to print, for each artist, "My favorite song by [Artist] is [Song]."
